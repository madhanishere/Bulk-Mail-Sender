Configure Environment Variables

To ensure security, credentials should be stored in environment variables. Use your Gmail address and an App Password (recommended when using two-factor authentication):

On macOS/Linux:

export EMAIL_USER="your_email@gmail.com"

On Windows (Command Prompt):

set EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
set EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password

Usage

Run the email sender script via the command line:

python send_emails.py

Expected output will include confirmations of successful sends or error notifications.

Exclude any sensitive files from version control systems.

Prefer app-specific passwords for Gmail accounts to enhance security.
